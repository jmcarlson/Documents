Notes - 06/16

- put js refs in body not head.  must load it before page if in head
- html 5 vs xhtml.  xhtml is old, use html 5
- don't need closing tags; DOCTYPE, meta, link
- cdnjs.cloudflare.com? (content delivery network, CDN)
- CDN's are distributed and super fast for loading.  Great for caching if common files are used
- terms: tags, elements(<head> section as a whole)
- Default CSS settings are vendor/browser based.  Should override defaults just in case
- Use "CSS Reset" stylesheet to zero out/reset the default values
- Use Normalize stylesheet to reset and then default to standard settings (best practice)
*** normalize.css(MIT), for example
*** Use 'minified' files; normalize.min.css
*** CNN uses hplib-min.css
- CTL-ALT-i opens developer tools in Chrome
- Firefox has 3D model view of a site in Inspector tools
- "git init" to create initial repo
- "git add -A" adds files to staging area(not committed).  Includes adds and deletes here
- git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- git "HEAD" is most recent commit
- git reset removes file from staging area; opposite of add.  doesn't affect commit history
- git remote add is local setup only; does not make connection
- git "origin" is name of the remote.  name is arbritrary; set by "git remote add"
- git push will not work if changes on the remote side exist.  Unless, the changes
  are being pushed from the local repo as well.
- CSS when transforming focus on an element that is not going to change.  So, use parent element for a transform since it will not be changing.  Ex) .portfolio-item:hover .front {} versus .front:hover {}
