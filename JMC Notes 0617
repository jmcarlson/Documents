JMC Notes 0617

- Most used CSS commands: display, position, float, 
- Default behavior: block elements are stacked on top of each other(w line breaks)
  and have width of 100%
- <h*>, <p> are block level elements
- "display: inline" displays right to left.  Inline elements can't have width/height
  values.  Size is based on the data.  Will wrap based on container size
- Yeoman: sudo npm install -g yo, sudo npm install -g generator-refactoru-html
- Yeoman: "yo refactoru-html"
