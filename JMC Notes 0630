JMC Notes 0630

Deeper into Functions

- Scenario: function receives too few arguments.  Missing argument will 
  be undefined.  *** Issue if missing arg is in the front.  test this...
- Scenario: function receives too many arguments.  "arguments" array contains
  all arguments passed into the function regardless
- "arguments" is array-like but isn't array; can't use array methods
- "arguments.length" property will work along with other properties
- "arguments" and jQuery object("$('.button')") is similar type
- Defaulting an argument: too few args
  if(!city) { city = "Boulder"} is the same as
  city = city || "Boulder";  (more common)
  people.push({name: name, city: city || "Boulder"})
- Terms: truthy and falsey???
- Scenario: too many args
  var sum = function() {
    var total = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
  }

- Recommendation: if nbr of args is variable, use arrays because
  you can take advantage of the array methods(slice, map, etc)
