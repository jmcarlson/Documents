JMC Notes 0709

OOP Demo:

- Smaller sites may not warrant OOP approach
- Easy Manager???
- SVG: scalable vector graphic
- fontello.com: icon fonts generator
  Ex) <i class="icon-trophy"></i>.  Class name matches name on website
  Use <link> to include CSS file (fontello.css)

- underscrore.js has _.random(x,y) which generates number between x and y

- Value of 'this' in an anonymous function is set to window
  Even if it's embedded inside a class/constructor structure
  *** "var that = this;", "var self = this;".  Use this approach
  to store the instance self that's used by anonymous function
  This is called "losing it's context"

- parseInt() for adding numbers to pixels.  Ex) parseInt("10px") + 50 will = 60

- In a class/constructor, you can define a property inline
  ex) this.el = $('<div>')

- "var self = this" should be used; NOT this.self = this.  The latter would
  still lose it's context

Instance properties:
	this.<property name>
	*** executed everytime an instance is created

Prototype properties:
	constructor.prototype.<property name>
	*** executed just once; way more efficient

- method/properties are looked up realtime, up the prototype chain
