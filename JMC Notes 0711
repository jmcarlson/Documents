JMC Notes 0711

Bootstrap!

- Twitter bootstrap; getbootstrap.com
- competitors: skeleton, semantic, foundation
- It's a front-end framework
- CDN name is "twitter-bootstrap"
- normalize stylesheet is baked into bootstrap
- Be careful which version; v2 is not great, use v3
- Fully responsive system for multi column layouts
- By default, bootstrap splits columns up into 12
  *** To size, choose how to group the 12 columns
- Bootstrap includes the media queries to adjust
  the screen

- Can nest grids within grids
  *** Within 2x8x2 grid, you could split the 8
  up into another 12 columns

- <div class="row"> is grid container, must be nested into
  either .container(fixed) or .container-fluid(floats to 100%) div

ex) 2 x 8 x 2 grid

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-2"></div>
	<div class="col-md-8"></div>
	<div class="col-md-2"></div>
</div>

ex) 2 x 8 x 2 grid with nested 2 x 10

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-2"></div>
	<div class="col-md-8"></div>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-2"></div>
		<div class="col-md-10"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-2"></div>
</div>

- all "row" sections take up 100% of the area(screen or nested)
- "md" in class name indicates device size

- Do NOT change the padding around the columns.  It throws the calculations off entirely
	*** Research gutter settings and Sass
- Can use offset classes; col-md-offset-1

- Can choose the modules in Bootstrap to deploy
  *** Hit customize section, select modules and download the file
  *** Must host on local server; check CDN file size vs local file size
