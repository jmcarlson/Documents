JMC Notes 0721

Node.js

- ECMA standard

Diffs from browser:
- no window object
- no DOM
- Node is module based; 'require' (like includes)
  <script> in browser is similar to 'require'
- low level access; filesystem, OS, networking
- Chrome runtime engine pulled out of browser
  and put into runtime environment


CTRL-C: 
CTRL-D: 

- Can setup file like a script
  use '#!/usr/bin/env node' in js file

Node globals:
- console
- __filename
- __dirname
- process


Require method:
- local
- core
- npm

- require does NOT include the added file to the namespace, default
- put 'module.exports' at end of file; nothing else after

- Object {}, Array []

- require('os')


Node Package Manager (npm)
- online repo of packages
- cmd tools
- "npm init" 
- "npm info <package>" lists info on package
!!!! Put modules in each project directory; don't 
  use global areas
- "npm install --save" updates package.json file
- "npm uninstall --save"
- "npm install" will read package.json and download dependencies
- Include package.json in git repo
