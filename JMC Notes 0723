JMC Notes 0723

Model-View-Controller (MVC)

- concept/pattern; words aren't reserved
- MVC can be in both client and server

- Model: data related (arrays of data, filter logic)
- View: UI
- Controller: 'glue', connects everything together
  ex) pulling data from model sending to view
  ex) event handling
  ex) messaging

- MVC helps decouple things; easier to maintain
- Stricter separation: put diff components in 
  diff files

Breakdowns of MVC:
- event handlers with heavy jquery action
- static html with embedded data

Fix:
- Put event handler/jquery-related functions in separate js???
- ???


- MVC on client, MC on server
- Separate out client, server files???

- Route handlers are controllers
- "Front Controller" first or entry route(app.js)
