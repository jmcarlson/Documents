JMC Notes 0806

User Authentication (Passport)

- Lots of setup...
- "Strategies" allow use of
  whatever auth mechinism you 
  want (local, Twitter, FB, etc)

- Heroku provides SSL for free!

package.json: (not complete list)
 - bcrypt
 - connect-flash
 - cookie-parser

- app.set, app.use order is important!

- for 'secret' property, could use node process.env
  environment variable

- Idea: could use jade if statements to 
  test for application security?

- Typical middleware function:
  "function(req, res, next, user)""

- Heroku configuration; research Heroku Dev Center
  Configuration vars
